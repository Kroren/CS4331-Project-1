<h2 id="the-old-microwave">The Old Microwave</h2>
<p>For this project, I used the microwave located in my kitchen. The interface isn&#39;t bad and actually works quite
    well, but there were thinks that could certainly be improved.</p>

<ul>
    <li>This microwave&#39;s interface is certainly one of the better ones I&#39;ve used, but faces the same common
        problems most microwaves seem to face.<ul>
            <li>There are a ton of cook options above the keypad that are almost never used<ul>
                    <li>Many people I know, including myself, never use these options and just put food in for an amount
                        of time that seems reasonable.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>The default buttons are preset to times (i.e. 1 - 1 minute, 2 - 2 minutes, etc)<ul>
                    <li>This is good for speed and convenience, but makes it hard to input accurate times without extra
                        input.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>No easy way to adjust power. Many foods don&#39;t call for powerful microwaves and often list wattage.
            </li>
            <li>The buttons are all a similar color.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>With this design, its very easy to make a mistake which could lead to overcooking or even burning your food
        without accurate times!&#39;<h2 id="some-improvements-that-can-be-made">Some improvements that can be made</h2>
    </li>
    <li>More distinct start/stop buttons</li>
    <li>Removal/condensing of the top buttons</li>
    <li>Easy way to adjust power/temperature</li>
    <li>Removal of &quot;quick cook&quot; functions for more accurate times.</li>
</ul>

<p>For my redesigning of the interface, I chose to put a focus on the keypad and start/stop buttons, as they&#39;re the
    most important part of the microwave&#39;s functions.</p>
<ul>
    <li>All of the less used buttons have been compressed into a single dropdown menu above the keypad</li>
    <li>The Start/Stop buttons are bigger than the keypad</li>
    <li>The Start/Stop buttons are colored differently than the keypad.</li>
    <li>The power is easily changeable through a quick toggle on the top right.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="tools-used">Tools Used</h2>
<p>1) Processing-java
    2) ControlP5 library for Processing-java
    3) Visual Studio Code</p>
