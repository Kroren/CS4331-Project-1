## The Old Microwave
For this project, I used the microwave located in my kitchen.  The interface isn't bad and actually works quite well, but there were thinks that could certainly be improved.

* This microwave's interface is certainly one of the better ones I've used, but faces the same common problems most microwaves seem to face.
    * There are a ton of cook options above the keypad that are almost never used
        * Many people I know, including myself, never use these options and just put food in for an amount of time that seems reasonable.
    * The default buttons are preset to times (i.e. 1 - 1 minute, 2 - 2 minutes, etc)
        * This is good for speed and convenience, but makes it hard to input accurate times without extra input.
    * No easy way to adjust power.  Many foods don't call for powerful microwaves and often list wattage.
    * The buttons are all a similar color.
* With this design, its very easy to make a mistake which could lead to overcooking or even burning your food without accurate times!'
## Some improvements that can be made
* More distinct start/stop buttons
* Removal/condensing of the top buttons
* Easy way to adjust power/temperature
* Removal of "quick cook" functions for more accurate times.

## The Redesign

For my redesigning of the interface, I chose to put a focus on the keypad and start/stop buttons, as they're the most important part of the microwave's functions.

* All of the less used buttons have been compressed into a single dropdown menu above the keypad
* The Start/Stop buttons are bigger than the keypad
* The Start/Stop buttons are colored differently than the keypad.
* The power is easily changeable through a quick toggle on the top right.
